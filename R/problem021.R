# Problem 21: Amicable numbers
# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
#
# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110;
# therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
#
# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.


# For an integer n with prime factorization n = p1^e1 * ... * pN^eN,
# The divisors (including n itself) are the cartesian product of the
# prime factors pi raised to each power between 0 and ei:
#
# Divisors = {p1^0,...,p1^e1} X ... X {pN^0,...,pN^eN}.
#
# Similarly, the sum of the divisors of n is simply the product
# sum(divisors(n)) = (p1^0 + ... + p1^e1) X ... X (pN^0 + ... + pN^eN)
#                  = \prod_{i=1}^{N}{\sum_{j=0}^{e_{i}}{p_{i}^{j}}}
#                  = \prod_{i=1}^{N}{(1-p_{i}^{e_{i}+1})/(1-p_{i})}, by the formula for sum of a geometric series.

# The sum of the proper divisors is simply this value minus n.
