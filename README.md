Project Euler in R.

Created using `usethis::create_package()`, as well as other `usethis` helpers as described in 
[R Packages, 2nd Edition](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html).

Run `testthat` unit tests by calling `test()`. Individual test files can be run by calling `test_file()`:
```r
test_file("tests/testthat/test-problem001.R")
```
